This is a Unblocked School AI.

**NOTICE** This only descises chat.openai.com. There is a major flaw in the blocker code where it does not check base domain. But only if it is a directory of a domain it does check it and flags it. If this is fixed, Oh well. A new Bug has been found and because there is no more required login and chat.openai.com/auth used to trigger that, It has no need to go there therfore, no trigger.

## How to use:
First, Look up "School 10382" and then encode it in base64 and then look that up, Then click on this page. It may look kinda junky but that will be fixed in further updates.
